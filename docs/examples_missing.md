# Examples have not been generated

The documentation pages for all examples are automatically generated using a custom mdbook pre-processor. This pre-processor did not run.

If you are seeing this after building the docs locally, please have a look at the mdbook output for errors and warnings.

If you are seeing this in the hosted version online, please open an [issue](https://github.com/schilkp/circumspect/issues).
